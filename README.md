# portfolioLOTR

This is a personal portfolio website with Python Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The theme is based on Lord of the Rings. 

It pretty much covers multiple pages for index page, pags about my personal and professional lives.

The background videos and musics are taken from internet. Musics are free.

The index page (looks amazing, right?) is as shown below:
